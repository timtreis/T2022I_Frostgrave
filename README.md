## F.A.Q.
- What is the maximum Armour value?
	- Permanent warband members may never have an Armour Stat greater than 15. If any combination of items, magic, or special affects would take them above 15, treat it as 15 instead. Creatures are not subject to this limitation, even if they temporarily join a warband. (p36)
- Who can carry how much and where did I get that from?
	- All wizards, apprentices, and soldiers in Frostgrave have at least one slot for carrying items. Wizards have five slots, apprentices have four, and soldiers have one. For soldiers, this single item slot is in addition to whatever equipment they receive as standard (listed in their stat-lines). A starting wizard may choose their items from the General Arms and Armour List (page 33), except that they may not wear any type of armour or carry shields as these interfere with spellcasting. In a campaign, wizards can change their items after each game, so if they find a magic staff or an interesting potion, they can carry them in the next game. (p26)
