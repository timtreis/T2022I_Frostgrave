## F.A.Q.
- What is the maximum Armour value?
	- Permanent warband members may never have an Armour Stat greater than 15. If any combination of items, magic, or special affects would take them above 15, treat it as 15 instead. Creatures are not subject to this limitation, even if they temporarily join a warband. (p36)
