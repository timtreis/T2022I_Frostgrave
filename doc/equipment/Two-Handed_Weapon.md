# Two-Handed Weapon
This includes any kind of heavy melee weapon that requires two hands to wield, such as two-handed swords, battle-axes, polearms, large flails, and heavy spears. These weapons do +2 damage. Because they are so bulky, these weapons take up two item slots. So, a wizard carrying a two-handed weapon may only carry up to three other items.
