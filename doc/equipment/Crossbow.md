# Crossbow
Crossbows take one action to load and one action to fire. If a figure wishes, it may replace its movement action with a ‘reload’ action. Crossbows have a +2 damage modifier. Crossbows also have a maximum range of 24”. It is assumed that all crossbows start the game loaded and ready to fire. In order to use a crossbow, a figure must also be carrying a [Quiver](Quiver.md) (which fills another item slot) or some type of magic ammunition.
