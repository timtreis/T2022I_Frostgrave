# Bow
The most common form of missile weapon in Frostgrave is the bow. The game makes no distinction between types of bow, and players are free to depict them as longbows, composite bows, etc. Bows may be loaded and fired in a single action. For game purposes, the maximum range of a bow is 24”, as there should never be more than 24” of open line of sight anywhere in the close confines of the Frozen City. In order to use a bow, a figure must also be carrying a [[Quiver]] (which fills another item slot) or some type of magic ammunition.
