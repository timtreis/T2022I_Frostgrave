# Random Encounter Table
If all players agree beforehand, the game may include the chance of random creatures showing up on the table to menace the wizards and their warbands. 

When each treasure token is picked up for the first time during a game, roll a die. On a 10 or more, a random creature has wandered onto the table. Roll on the Random Encounter Table below to see which creature (or creatures) has appeared. Then, roll randomly to determine from which side of the table the creature enters. The creature should be placed in the centre of that table edge, or as near to the centre as logically makes sense. The creature will activate in the next Creature phase, and follows the standard rules for uncontrolled creatures, unless specific rules are given in its description. 

Alternatively, players may prefer to pre-generate encounters or create their own random encounter tables to match their miniature collections. 

Although this rule is optional, it is highly recommended. Many players find random encounters to be one of their favourite aspects of the game. If you want to face even more of the denizens of the Frozen City, roll to generate an encounter at the end of every turn instead of (or as well as) when picking up treasure.
