# Apothecary
Apothecaries start each game with a [Healing_Potion](../equipment/Healing_Potion.md) (see page 91). An apothecary may spend an action to give a potion to a member of the same warband within 1‚Äù, provided neither are in combat. The figure receiving the potion counts as having drunk it, and effects are applied immediately. Note that this rule applies to any potion carried by an apothecary, not just their free [Healing_Potion](../equipment/Healing_Potion.md).
