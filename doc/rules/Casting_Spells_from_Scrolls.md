# Casting Spells from Scrolls
Scrolls are pieces of parchment that have a spell saved on them in the form of writing. Scrolls can be used in two different ways. If a spellcaster has a scroll of a spell they don’t know, they may use it to cast that spell. In this case, they simply spend an action, the scroll is destroyed, and the spell is successfully cast. Treat the Casting Roll for the spell as 14, regardless of the spell’s casting number.

Alternatively, if the scroll contains a spell the spellcaster does know, they may use it as a form of spellcasting insurance. The spellcaster may attempt to cast the spell as normal. If they fail their Casting Roll, they may use the scroll. The scroll is discarded, and the spell is successfully cast. Treat the Casting Roll for the spell as 14, regardless of the spell’s casting number. In this case, the spellcaster takes no damage from failing their Casting Roll. A scroll may be used in this way even
if the Casting Roll was a natural 1. Spells cast from scrolls may never be empowered. Spellcasters never earn experience points for spells cast using scrolls. 

Non-spellcasters may not use scrolls.
