# Zombie
Zombies probably outnumber all the other inhabitants of Frostgrave combined. Unlike skeletons, these undead were reanimated soon after death and still have most of their flesh. Before the cataclysm, zombies were chiefly used as household servants and messengers. Now, they have gone feral and hunger for living flesh.
