# Curse
[Witch](doc/rules/Witch.md) / 8 / Line of Sight

The target suffers -2 to all die rolls. At the end of each turn, the target may make a Will Roll with the Target Number equal to the Casting Roll (at -2, of course). If successful, this spell is cancelled. Curse cannot be cast on a figure already suffering the effects of a Curse spell.
