# Animate Construct
#Enchanter / 10 / Out of Game (B)

It is assumed that the spellcaster has built a construct prior to using this spell to animate it. If the spell is successfully cast, the construct immediately becomes a permanent member of the
warband, taking the place of a soldier. A spellcaster must declare the size of construct they are attempting to animate (small, medium, or large â€“ page 183 before rolling to cast the spell. The
larger the construct, the harder it is to animate, so the following modifiers are applied to the Casting Roll: [[Small_Construct]] -0, [[Medium_Construct]] -3, [[Large_Construct]] -6. There is no limit to the number of constructs in a warband other than the normal limits for soldiers. Large constructs count as specialist soldiers, the others as standard soldiers.
