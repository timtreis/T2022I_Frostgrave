# Elemental Ball
#Elementalist / 12 / Line of Sight

The spellcaster selects an enemy figure within 16” and line of sight and hurls a ball of destructive elemental energy at it. The target and every figure within 1” and line of sight of the target
immediately suffers a +5 elemental magic shooting attack. Roll this shooting attack separately for each figure. Treat the target figure as the origin of the attack for the purposes of determining
cover or intervening terrain for all other figures suffering the attack. This spell may not target an enemy figure that is even partially obscured by another figure.
