#Enchanter / 10 / Line of Sight
 
The spellcaster takes an object, commonly a simple rock, imbues it with magic energy and throws it at their target, whereupon it explodes into hundreds of fragments. The spellcaster picks a target point within 14”. Every figure, including allies, within 1.5” of that point immediately suffers a +3 magic shooting attack. Use the target point as the origin of the attack for working out line of sight and cover.
