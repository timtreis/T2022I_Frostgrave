# Telekinesis
#Enchanter / 10 / Line of Sight

The spellcaster may move any treasure token within 16” by up to 6” in any direction, so long as it remains in line of sight the entire time. If the treasure moves out of line of sight, it immediately falls straight to the ground. This spell has no effect on a treasure token that has any special requirements for how and when it can be picked up, nor on one being carried by a figure. This spell may not target the central treasure, until after that treasure has been picked up for the first time.
