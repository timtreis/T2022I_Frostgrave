# Elemental Shield
#Elementalist / 10 / Self Only

The spellcaster forms a floating shield that absorbs the next 3 points of damage the spellcaster would normally suffer in combat or from a shooting attack. Once 3 points have been absorbed the spell is cancelled. A spellcaster may only have one Elemental Shield active at any time.
