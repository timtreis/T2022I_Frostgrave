# Furious Quill
#Sigilist / 10 / Line of Sight

The target is attacked by a sharp animated quill. Although the quill does no damage, it is highly irritating and extremely distracting. While under attack, the target suffers -1 Move, -2 Fight, -4 Shoot, and -2 to all Casting Rolls. Whenever the target is activated, it may make a Will Roll with a Target Number equal to the Casting Roll â€“ if successful, the quill is caught and destroyed. Multiple castings of Furious Quill against the same target have no effect.
