# Raise Zombie
#Necromancer / 10 / Out of Game (B) OR Touch

The spellcaster adds one [Zombie](../monsters/Zombie.md) (page 193) to their warband as a temporary member. If the spell is cast before the game, the zombie can be deployed normally. If it is cast during a game, the zombie appears in base contact with the spellcaster. A warband may only have one raised zombie at any one time. If the zombie is killed or exits the table, Raise Zombie can be cast again to create another.
