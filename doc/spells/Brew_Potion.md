# Brew Potion
[[doc/rules/Witch]] / 12 / Out of Game (B)

The spellcaster creates one Lesser Potion of their choice (page 86) that may be sold, stored in the wizard’s vault, or given to a member of the warband. A wizard (and only a wizard) may use this spell to create a Greater Potion (page 87). First, they must declare what potion they are attempting to brew and pay the listed ingredients cost. The wizard should then roll to cast Brew Potion with a -4 to the Casting Roll. If successful, the potion is created and can be immediately assigned to a figure in the warband, sold, or stored in the wizard’s vault. If unsuccessful, the potion is not created and the money spent on ingredients is lost.
