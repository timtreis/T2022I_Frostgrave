# Mind Control
[[Soothsayer]] / 12 / Line of Sight

The target figure must make an immediate Will Roll with a Target Number equal to the Casting Roll. If it fails, the target temporarily joins the spellcasterâ€™s warband, activating as normal. After the figure activates each turn, it must make another Will Roll with a Target Number equal to the Casting Roll. If successful, the spell is cancelled and the figure returns to its normal allegiance. A spellcaster may only have one active Mind Control spell at a time. A figure under Mind
Control cannot purposely take any action that causes it immediate damage but can be moved into combat and may attack an enemy figure. A figure under Mind Control is not allowed to move off the table. A spellcaster may cancel an active Mind Control at the end of any turn. This spell has no effect on spellcasters.
