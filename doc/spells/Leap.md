# Leap
#Summoner / 8 / Line of Sight

This spell may only be cast on a member of the spellcaster’s warband. Immediately move the target figure up to 10” in any direction, including vertically. This move must either be in a
straight line or an arc. It cannot curve around corners. If this move leaves the figure above the ground, it immediately falls, taking damage as normal. If the target is carrying treasure, this move is reduced to 5”. This move may not take a figure off the table or into combat. The target of the Leap spell may take no other actions this turn, though it may have taken actions previously.
