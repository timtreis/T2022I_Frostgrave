# Wizard Eye
#Soothsayer / 8 / Line of Sight

This spell may be cast on any terrain feature within 12‚Äù that has a flat side, such as most ruins. Place a token on or next to the terrain feature to represent the Wizard Eye. For the rest of the game, the caster may choose to draw line of sight from the Wizard Eye instead of from the figure when casting spells. The Wizard Eye has 180-degree field of vision. A spellcaster may only maintain one Wizard Eye at a time. If the terrain piece on which the Wizard Eye is placed is damaged or destroyed (such as by a [Crumble](Crumble.md) spell) the spell is cancelled. The spellcaster may cancel this spell at the end of any turn.
